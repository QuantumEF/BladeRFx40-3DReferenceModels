This is intended to be a reference model for creating designs around the BladeRF x40 as well as the XB200 expansion module.

Measurements are partially retrieved from https://www.nuand.com/bladerf_top.dxf, but many are just measured with calipers. I did my best to measure and place things as accurately and precisely as possible: hopefully close enough to where the 3D print tolerances of the case are larger.

If both the XB200 and x40 main-board are used together, the XB200 should be placed 0.5 inches above the main-board: i.e. if the main-board is positioned at 0, 0, 0, the XB200 should be placed at 0, 0, 0.5

The cad model was dimensioned with imperial units since that is the system that seems the bladerf was designed around.
